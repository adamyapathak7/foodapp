      <p>How many times have you heard this? How many times did you think it? Me too! 
        Thatâ€™s why I was determined to think of a way to simplify 
        this process and reduce the time from thinking of a meal and begin to cook.
         The endless wondering of what to eat is a burden to us all. I think that this app will help a lot of people.</p>
